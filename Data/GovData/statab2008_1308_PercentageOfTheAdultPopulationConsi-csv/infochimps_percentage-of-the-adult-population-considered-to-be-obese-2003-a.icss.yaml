    This is an Infochimps Simple Schema (ICSS).

    It describes data on Infochimps.com and is meant to be both human
    and machine readable.

    An ICSS file is distributed with every download on Infochimps and
    is also available by request to the above URL.
    
    ICSS files bundled with downloads are generated at the time the
    download was created so they can become out of date as changes are
    made to the data.  If this ICSS came with data you downloaded then
    it is possible that it is already out of date.  You can get the
    most recent version at the URL above.

    The Statistical Abstract files are distributed by the "US Census Department":http://www.census.gov/population/www/popdata.html as Microsoft Excel files. These files have data mixed with notes and references, multiple tables per sheet, and, worst of all, the table headers are not easily matched to their rows and columns.
    
    A few files had extraneous characters in the title. These were corrected to be consistent. A few files have a sheet of crufty gibberish in the first slot. The sheet order was shuffled but no data were changed.
    
    The tables that were changed (this is table 1308):
    
    <pre>
    0166 0257 0362 0429 0445 0446 0459 0461 0462 0464 0465 0466 0467
    0469 0479 0480 0481 0482 0483 0484 0485 0486 0487 0559 0628 0629
    1144 1227 1231
    </pre>
    
    This dataset consists of a table of 33 rows and 5 columns.
    
    
    Obesity rates are defined as the percentage of the population with a Body Mass Index (BMI) over 30 kg/m 2. The BMI is a single number that evaluates an individual's weight status in relation to height (weight/height 2, with weight in kilograms and height in meters). For Australia, the United Kingdom, and the United States, figures are based on health examinations, rather than self-reported information. Obesity estimates derived from health examinations are generally higher and more reliable than those coming from self-reports because they preclude any misreporting of people's height and weight. However, health examinations are only conducted regularly in a few countries. For more information on methods by country, see &lt; www.irdes.fr/ecosante/OCDE/814010.html &gt;
