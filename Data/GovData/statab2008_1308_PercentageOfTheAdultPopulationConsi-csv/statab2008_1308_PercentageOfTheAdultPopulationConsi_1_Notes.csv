HEADNOTE
[Obesity rates are defined as the percentage of the population with a Body Mass Index (BMI) over 30
"kg/m \2. The BMI is a single number that evaluates an individual's weight status in relation to height"
"(weight/height \2, with weight in kilograms and height in meters). For Australia, the United Kingdom, and the"
"United States, figures are based on health examinations, rather than self-reported information. Obesity"
estimates derived from health examinations are generally higher and more reliable than those coming from
"self-reports because they preclude any misreporting of people's height and weight. However, health"
examinations are only conducted regularly in a few countries. For more information on methods
"by country, see <www.irdes.fr/ecosante/OCDE/814010.html>]"
