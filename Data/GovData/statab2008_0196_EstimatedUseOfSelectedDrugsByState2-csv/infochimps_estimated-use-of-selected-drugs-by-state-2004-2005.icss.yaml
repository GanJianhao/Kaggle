    This is an Infochimps Simple Schema (ICSS).

    It describes data on Infochimps.com and is meant to be both human
    and machine readable.

    An ICSS file is distributed with every download on Infochimps and
    is also available by request to the above URL.
    
    ICSS files bundled with downloads are generated at the time the
    download was created so they can become out of date as changes are
    made to the data.  If this ICSS came with data you downloaded then
    it is possible that it is already out of date.  You can get the
    most recent version at the URL above.

    The Statistical Abstract files are distributed by the "US Census Department":http://www.census.gov/population/www/popdata.html as Microsoft Excel files. These files have data mixed with notes and references, multiple tables per sheet, and, worst of all, the table headers are not easily matched to their rows and columns.
    
    A few files had extraneous characters in the title. These were corrected to be consistent. A few files have a sheet of crufty gibberish in the first slot. The sheet order was shuffled but no data were changed.
    
    The tables that were changed (this is table 196):
    
    <pre>
    0166 0257 0362 0429 0445 0446 0459 0461 0462 0464 0465 0466 0467

    1144 1227 1231
    </pre>
    
    This dataset consists of a table of 62 rows and 11 columns.
    
    
    19,396 represents 19,396,000. Data in this table cover a 2 year period. Data is based on the National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH). Current users are those persons 12 years old and over who used drugs at least once within month prior to this study. Based on national sample of respondents (see also headnote, Table 195). The state estimates were produced by combining the prevalence rate based on the state sample data and the prevalence rate based on a national regression model applied to local-area county and census block group/tract-level estimates from the state (i.e., a survey-weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach). The parameters of the regression model are estimated from the entire national sample. For comparison purposes, the data shown here display estimates for all 50 states and the District of Columbia utilizing the modeled estimates for all 51 areas
