HEADNOTE
"[19,396 represents 19,396,000."
Data in this table cover a 2 year period. Data is based on the 
National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH). 
Current users are those persons 12 years old and over who used drugs at least once 
within month prior to this study. Based on national sample of 
"respondents (see also headnote, Table 195)."
The state estimates were produced by combining the prevalence rate based on the state sample data and
the prevalence rate based on a national regression model applied to local-area county and census block
"group/tract-level estimates from the state (i.e., a survey-weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach). "
"The parameters of the regression model are estimated from the entire national sample. For comparison purposes,"
the data shown here display estimates for all 50 states and the District of Columbia utilizing the modeled
estimates for all 51 areas]
